I'm a Physics Master Student at the University of Vienna and I'm writing my Master's thesis with a focus on the interplay of structure and dynamics in cellular monolayers. In my thesis I explore various perspectives from real space analysis (tracking, PIV, Cytometry (segmentation  of fluorescent nuclei, Voronoi tessellation)) and Fourier space analysis (DDM, static structure factor) to characterise these interplays.
