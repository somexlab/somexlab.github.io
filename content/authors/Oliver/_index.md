As a master’s student I am currently doing an internship working on the Myxococcus xanthus bacterium. My research focuses on their motility, interesting properties and applications of gene editing workflows especially introduction of plasmids for their multiplication. Currently we are focused an developing good ways to culture the bacterium and to find ways to introduce new 
Plasmids with markers, the bacterium can use to reproduce them. Apart from that we look for proper ways to image the bacteria for analysis and quantification of the results.
