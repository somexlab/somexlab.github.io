I am a master's student in Physics at the University of Vienna, currently doing my thesis in Robertoâ€™s research group. My work focuses on thermally induced transitions in ECM-based composite hydrogels for 3D bioprinting, with an emphasis on rheological characterization and its impact on printability and structural fidelity.
