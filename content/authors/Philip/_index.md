I completed my Physics Masters in 2024 and worked in the laboratory of **[Prof. Cerbino](https://mohan8488.github.io/group-website-test/author/roberto-cerbino/)** for my thesis. My work involved the experimental investigation of thermophoresis, the induced movement of micro-scaled particles in response to temperature gradients within a fluid. Specifically, I studied how the shape of particles influences this movement by comparing ellipsoidal particles with different aspect ratios.

Post-graduation, I focused on the field of time series forecasting within the energy market. My work primarily revolves around developing signal decomposition techniques and machine learning models.
