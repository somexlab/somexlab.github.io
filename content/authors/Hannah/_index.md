I am a Physics Master's student at the University of Vienna. In my thesis, I work on developing and extending a method to determine the electrophoretic mobility and consequently the zeta potential of colloidal particles. My goal is to assess the potential of Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) as a scalable and accurate approach for electrokinetic characterization, particularly for systems beyond the optical resolution limit. My work combines real-space particle tracking with Fourier-based analysis. The aim is to establish whether it is possible to make precise mobility measurements for smaller particles without relying exclusively on DDM.
