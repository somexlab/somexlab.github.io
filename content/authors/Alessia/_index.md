I am enrolled in an inter-university PhD program at the Polytechnic of Bari and University of Bari Aldo Moro (Italy) under the supervision of **[Prof. Luigi Gentile](https://sites.google.com/view/luigigentile/home?authuser=0)** since November 2022. My PhD thesis is focused on the formulation and characterization of fuel gels for aerospace propulsion.
I am a visiting PhD student at University of Vienna collaborating with **[Prof. Roberto Cerbino]({{< relref "/authors/admin/_index.md" >}})**'s research group. Here I am leading a deeper investigation of my samples by integrating microscopy, microrheology, bulk rheology and rheo-optics, with the goal of understanding the connection between the microstructural and dynamical properties with the macroscopic mechanical behavior of the fuel gels.
