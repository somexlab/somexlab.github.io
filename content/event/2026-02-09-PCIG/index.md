summary: 17th European Summer School on scattering methods.
abstract:  'The Bombannes summer school is devoted to the practical *state-of-art* approach to scattering methods, using neutrons, as well as X-ray and light sources - today’s key techniques to study structure and dynamics in systems containing colloids, polymers, surfactants and biological macromolecules. Since 1990 the Bombannes school series introduces, on a fundamental level, the current methodology of static and dynamic scattering techniques and their application to soft matter systems. It provides with a period of 2 years advanced training for young researchers with a working place in European laboratories at post-graduate and post-doctoral level.'

#Slides can be added in a few ways:
#
#- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).
