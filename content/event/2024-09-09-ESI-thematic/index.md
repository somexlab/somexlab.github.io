summary: A meeting of leading researchers, early-career researchers and students working in the fields of inert soft materials and living soft materials as part of ESI Thematic Program 
abstract:  'An opportunity to bring together leading researchers, early-career researchers and students working in the communities of intert soft materials and living soft materials. We propose a 6-week ESI Thematic Program organized around the following keywords: *Failure, Yielding, Fracture, Percolation, Jamming, Rigidity, Flocking, Topology, Defects, Memory, Confinement.* <br> A cornerstone of the program is the adoption of a combined theoretical, numerical and experimental perspective that will provide an invaluable overview of the current research and promote the integration of different perspectives. In addition, the proposed program intends to facilitate the exchange of information and results among different communities interested in understanding the rheological behavior of inert and living soft materials, in particular across different length and time scales.<br> In addition, the program should prompt and facilitate interactions, and ideally identify new fundamental and applied problems, as well as strategic initiatives and directions of research.'

#Slides can be added in a few ways:
#
#- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).
