summary: Poster presentation at EMS COLLOQUIUM on design of a strain and stress-controlled linear rheometer.
abstract:  'The integration of rheology with microscopy has emerged as a powerful method to study shear-induced phenomena, like yielding. The key advantage of this approach lies in the microscopic visualization of samples under shear, facilitating detailed analyses in both real and reciprocal space, using techniques like particle tracking or Digital Fourier Microscopy. Here we present a custom-made linear shear-cell mounted on top of an inverted microscope, reviewing previously proposed methods while highlighting their strengths and limitations. Developing a feedback loop, we build a simple but robust device able to perform rheological measurements both in stress and strain-controlled mode, alongside microscopic observations on a commercial microscope. To facilitate replication, we offer a detailed presentation of the individual components and their importance in performing reliable rheological measurements while imaging. Our shear-cell, being considerably more affordable than commercial rheometers without compromising data quality, presents a cost-effective solution for enhancing rheometric capabilities in laboratories already equipped with microscopes.'
