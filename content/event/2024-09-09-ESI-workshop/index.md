  country: Austria

summary: Flagship Workshop organized as part of ESI Thematic Program 
abstract:  'The objective of the workshop is to bring together various communities that heavily rely on universal concepts like mechanical response and failure. There are numerous unresolved questions and ideas that can encourage a fruitful exchange of knowledge between these communities. Consistent with the [CECAM](https://www.cecam.org/) tradition, computer simulations are of utmost importance in these fields, serving as both a guiding tool for experiments and a modeling resource when theoretical approaches fall short. Furthermore, in the forthcoming years, the emerging AI/ML paradigm will significantly influence all fields of physics. By inviting experts in this domain, we aim to facilitate an open and comprehensive discussion regarding the impact of such paradigm on the workshops research themes.'

#Slides can be added in a few ways:
#
#- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).
