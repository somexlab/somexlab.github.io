It is supported by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the National Science Foundation, and many other organizations. This is the first ISMC on the American continent, and as such, it concludes the first cycle of the Soft Matter around the World in Three Years series of ISMCs.<br>The conference aims to bring together researchers from physics, chemistry, biology, chemical engineering, and materials science interested in various soft matter systems. We hope the conference will promote and intensify interdisciplinary collaborations and advance connections between academia and industry around soft matter technologies.'
