  street: Boltzmanngasse 9A
  city: Vienna
  region: AT
  postcode: '1090'
  country: Austria

summary: Summer school organized as part of ESI Thematic Program 
abstract:  'This school, organized with the additional support of the Vienna Doctoral School in Physics (VDSP), is part of the Erwin Schr√∂dinger Institute (ESI) thematic programme: [Linking Microscopic Processes to the Macroscopic Rheological Properties in Inert and Living Soft Materials](https://www.esi.ac.at/events/e519/) and aims at providing foundational lectures and discussions in Soft Matter Physics and Biophysics to early career researchers, including PhD candidates, postdocs, and exceptionally motivated MSc students.<br> Topics include self-assembly, dynamics, rheology of soft materials, biological tissues, cellular and tissue mechanics, and bio-elasticity and failure in both inert and living soft materials. An overview of experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches will be covered. <br> The Summer School will host approximately 50 students and will be free of charge for them. Additionally, students coming from outside Vienna will receive a daily allowance as a contribution to cover accommodation expenses.<br> The lectures will be scheduled for the morning, allowing for a range of activities in the afternoon. These activities include joint talks (e.g. bio&phys or theo&exp), tutorials, journal clubs.'

#Slides can be added in a few ways:
#
#- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).
