Members of Somex Lab, along with friends, took a short trip to the iconic [*Ottakringer Brewery*](https://www.ottakringerbrauerei.at/de/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhYS_BhD2ARIsAJTMMQbLWGu1fstVv6x6HtWnxLtodYZZesRh_MKk1twxxUKK63gMGfQcpt0aAs65EALw_wcB) to explore the art and science behind brewing one of Vienna’s most beloved beers.

Of course, no brewery visit is complete without the highlight of the day—a well-earned beer tasting! Cheers! :beer:
