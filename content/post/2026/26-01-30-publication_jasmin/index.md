Somex lab was part of two recent publications focused on cancer research and development of a tutorial on Myxococcus xanthus.

### Publication 1: 
**De Novo Gene Transcription of Connexin Mediates Cytoplasmic Fluid Exchange and Flocking Transitions in Physiological and Cancerous Epithelial Systems** 

This study explores how connexin transcription and gap-junction communication drive fluid-like transitions and collective cell migration in epithelial tissues. Our students [Jasmin]({{< relref "/authors/Jasmin/_index.md" >}}) and [Fabian]({{< relref "/authors/Fabian/_index.md" >}}) employed PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) analysis to measure the coordinated and ordered cell motions across the monolayers. In particular, correlation length and order parameter show a remarkable increase in the presence of epidermal growth factor, reflecting the collective alignment of cells.

### Publication 2: 
***Myxococcus xanthus* for active matter studies: a tutorial for its growth and potential applications** 

This tutorial provides a detailed, practical guide for cultivating, developing, and preparing experimental samples of M. xanthus. The tutorial also highlights several benchmark experiments—motility assays, fruiting body formation, predation, and elasticotaxis—all of which showcase how this organism can be used to explore the fundamentals of collective motion and emergent mechanics.

Our PhD student [Jasmin]({{< relref "/authors/Jasmin/_index.md" >}}) and intern student [David]({{< relref "/authors/David/_index.md" >}}) contributed by validating the protocols established in the tutorial.
