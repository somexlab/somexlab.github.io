We are delighted to host [Carlo Marietti]({{< relref "/authors/Carlo/_index.md" >}}) from the University of Milan. Carlo is here on the internship funded by [Vienna Doctoral School in Physics](https://vds-physics.univie.ac.at/?no_cache=1) that offers selected MSc students from inside and outside of Austria to be immersed in real world research with experts in their field for 2-6 months.

We're excited to have him on board and look forward to the insights his research will bring!

<strong>Probing fluctuation-induced forces in non-equilibrium fluids</strong>

[Casimir forces](https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/74/1/42/396280/Science-and-technology-of-the-Casimir-effectCaused) emerge when fluctuating fields are confined, as seen between uncharged, conducting plates in a vacuum or in fluids near a critical point. Out-of-equilibrium fluids exhibit even stronger fluctuations, which theory predicts should generate remarkably large Casimir-like forces in confined spaces. However, measuring these forces experimentally remains a challenge. In this project, we aim to overcome this barrier by using advanced optical techniques to track the interactions of colloidal particles suspended in a complex medium with giant fluctuations driven by diffusion or thermophoresis. Our goal is to provide the first direct experimental evidence of non-equilibrium Casimir-like forces - offering exciting new insights into fluctuation-induced interactions in soft matter physics.
