**1. University assistant postdoctoral (3+3 years)**

We are looking for an early career researcher (ECR) with expertise in optics, including microscopy, and image processing, with a preferred knowledge of Python. This position, common in universities in German-speaking countries, involves teaching responsibilities (around 4 hours per week) and offers the opportunity, if suitable, to work on a publication-ready habilitation thesis. The recruited ECR will contribute to the group's ongoing projects, especially those related to [Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.188102) experiments on soft and biological materials. Additionally, they are encouraged to develop scientific independence in areas of shared interest.

**Deadline for applications:** Closed\
**Starting date:** > 18.11.2024\
**Status:** Under evaluation


**2. FWF funded doctoral candidate (4 years)**

This position is funded in the framework of the recently accepted proposal ***Transforming Gels Through Training*** **(TRAINGEL)** for collaborative research between France (ANR) and Austria (FWF). The recruited researcher will work in close collaboration with the other project team members in Vienna (**[Christos Likos](https://comp-phys.univie.ac.at/likos/)**, UniWien), Lyon (**[Thomas Gibaud](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/thomas.gibaud/)**, ENS), Paris (**[Stefano Aime](https://sites.google.com/view/steaime/home?authuser=0)**, ESPCI), and Grenoble (**[Frédéric Pignon](https://sites.google.com/site/fredericpignon)**, CNRS). Within the main goal of the project, this student will primarily engage in experiments using rheology, microscopy, rheo-microscopy, and DDM to train hydrogels for cell culture, as well as to train colloidal gels through mechanical solicitation or by altering in a controlled fashion the interaction between the colloidal particles.

**Deadline for applications:** Closed\
**Starting date:** > 01.01.2025\
**Status:** Under evaluation
