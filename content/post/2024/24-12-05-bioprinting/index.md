Our PhD student [J. Di Franco]({{< relref "/authors/Jasmin/_index.md" >}}) and Lab Manager [Dr. Mohandas]({{< relref "/authors/Mohandas/_index.md" >}}) attended the **[Open Source 3D Bioprinting Workshop](https://biomed-forschung.meduniwien.ac.at/ueber-uns/events/3rd-european-open-source-3d-bioprinting-workshop-1/)** organized at the [Cardiovascular Institute](https://biomed-forschung.meduniwien.ac.at/en/research/cardiovascular-institute/) of the Medical University of Vienna. The workshop was conducted by [Dr. Karl Schneider](https://campus.meduniwien.ac.at/med.campus/visitenkarte.show_vcard?pPersonenId=68C76670E3947F37&pPersonenGruppe=3) and [Dr. Vincent Fitzpatrick](https://engineering.tufts.edu/bme/people/faculty/vincent-fitzpatrick) and involved building an Open-Source 3D Bioprinter from scratch. 

The participants learned the basics of 3D printing, hardware assembly and were able to make their own 3D bioprints using ***Placental Extracellular Matrix*** as the ink and the ***Bovine Gelatin*** as the supporting medium. Additionally, the participants were also given a sneak peek into the research activities of the Cardiovascular Institute.
