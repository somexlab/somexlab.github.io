[Roberto]({{< relref "/authors/Jasmin/_index.md" >}}) attended a [3 day workshop](https://hreworkshop-poland2024.eu/) organised by **[ESA](https://www.esa.int/)** at the PGE Narodowy National Stadium in Warsaw, Poland. There he presented his latest findings on the investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations during sedimentation. While the subject is intricate, understanding the mixing and transport of components in fluids is crucial for long-term space missions. In such missions, essential materials like fuels and food must be processed under microgravity conditions to ensure sustainability during extended space travel. In addition, he also presented the preliminary results of the activities of the **Facility Definition Team Soft Matter and Biophysics of the European Space Agency**, which has been working to define the features and requirements of space research facilities in the post-ISS era.
