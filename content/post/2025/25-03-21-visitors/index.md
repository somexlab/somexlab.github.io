Continuing our tradition of learning through collaboration, Somex Lab welcomes two visiting students this month: [Concetta Santangelo]({{< relref "/authors/Concetta/_index.md" >}}) from University of Milan and [Vinay Copnar]({{< relref "/authors/Vinay/_index.md" >}}) from Durham University.

Concetta is exploring the use of **FastDDM** for the quantitative characterization of biomolecular systems, while Vinay is employing **rheo-microscopy** to investigate the viscoelastic behavior of hybrid double-network hydrogels.
