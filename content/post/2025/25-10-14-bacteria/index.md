*Swarming motility of the bacteria on solid Agar substrate within 24hrs. Swarming behavior in the colony is recognised by the branching structures of cells moving in the same direction.*

Our bachelor student [Franz]({{< relref "/authors/Franz/_index.md" >}}) has recorded his first exciting movie with swarming bacteria. He along with our PhD student [Jasmin]({{< relref "/authors/Jasmin/_index.md" >}}), is using Cell-Tracking to investigate the motility and phase separation behaviour of the soil-dwelling bacterium [Myxococcus xanthus](https://www.mpi-marburg.mpg.de/824130/2020-04-a) ðŸ§« under starvation conditions. These starved bacteria colony form ***[Fruiting bodies](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_(Boundless)/06%3A_Culturing_Microorganisms/6.02%3A_Cell_Differentiation_and_Starvation/6.2C%3A_Starvation-Induced_Fruiting_Bodies)*** that can be described as a phase separation driven by changes in motility of the bacteria. Building on similar experiments [Franz]({{< relref "/authors/Franz/_index.md" >}}) aims to improve the imaging process and stability for further analysis.
