We are delighted to welcome [Maxime Lavaud]({{< relref "/authors/Maxime/_index.md" >}}) to our research group at the University of Vienna! Maxime brings a wealth of expertise in the field of [Confined Brownian Motion](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L032011) in Colloids and a passion for pushing the boundaries of Soft Matter physics.

As part of our team, Maxime will contribute to further the knowledge base of FastDDM, optical tweezers, and much more. We are eager to see the innovative ideas and fresh perspectives he will bring to the table.

We look forward to collaborating, learning, and achieving great things together. Welcome aboard, Maxime!
