We are inviting applications for a **PhD (48 months)** or **Postdoctoral (24 months)** position at the University of Vienna for the latest project ***[MechanoSynth — "Decoding and engineering multiscale mechanoresponses in synthetic and biological tissues"](https://www.wwtf.at/funding/programmes/ls/LS24-038/index.php?lang=EN)*** funded by [The Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF)](https://www.wwtf.at/wwtf/about-us/).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team spanning experimental soft matter physics, developmental biology, and biophysics theory, working to uncover how physical forces and molecular mechanosensing cooperate to define the material properties of living tissues.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

**Our group will develop and apply novel Opto-rheological and Rheomicroscopy platforms to probe** ***Biomimetic Emulsions or Vesicle systems*** and ***Zebrafish Gastruloids***, in close collaboration with [Diana Pinheiro](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/diana-pinheiro?cookies=CookieNotice=1;cookieNoticegta=0;cookieNoticevideo=0;cookieNoticetwitter=0) (IMP Vienna) and [Edouard Hannezo](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/hannezo-group/) (ISTA Klosterneuburg).

Responsibilities of the researcher:

– preparation and optimization of biomimetic systems (e.g. emulsions or vesicles),

– quantitative imaging and mechanical measurements of biomimetic and biological materials,

– development of experimental instrumentation combining rheology and optics, and

– development of analysis tools and simple biophysical models.

---

We seek applicants with training in ***two or more*** of the following areas: rheology, biophysics, and quantitative microscopy (PhD level), or with demonstrated independence and relevant expertise in these areas (postdoctoral level).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

The position is fully funded by **WWTF** and hosted at the [Faculty of Physics](https://physik.univie.ac.at/en/), University of Vienna, in a vibrant, collaborative environment at the interface of *Soft and Living matter*.

Applicants should send a **single PDF** containing:

– a brief motivation letter,

– a detailed CV, and

– the contact details of two referees,

accompanied by two recommendation letters sent directly by the referees.

---

All material should be sent to [Martina Benedikt]({{< relref "/authors/Martina/_index.md" >}}).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the position is filled, which should ideally happen before the end of the year.
