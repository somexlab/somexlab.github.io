As the year comes to a close, we’re taking a moment to look back on how far we’ve come in our research and all the knowledge we've shared and learned along the way. Feeling re-energized and curious, we're excited to see what challenges and opportunities the year ahead has in store.

Wishing everyone a joyful Christmas 🎄🎅 and a New Year 🎆 full of inspiration, new discoveries, and success—best wishes from the **SoMeX Lab**!
