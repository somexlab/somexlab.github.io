We are delighted to announce that our latest preprint, ***[ShearView: A Compact Stress- and Strain-Controlled Rheometer for Integrated Rheo-microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08951)***, has been submitted to *arXiv*. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Authored by our PhD student [Nikolaos Kalafatakis]({{< relref "/authors/Nikos/_index.md" >}}), this work introduces a custom-built, state-of-the-art rheometer capable of operating in both stress- and strain-controlled modes. Designed to be mounted on inverted microscopes, ***ShearView*** enables researchers to directly link bulk rheological measurements with microscopic dynamics in soft matter systems.

Beyond conventional rheology, ***ShearView*** supports a wide range of advanced experiments, including:
{style="text-align: justify;"}

---
✔️ Chirped strain oscillations

✔️ Recovery rheology

✔️ Rheo-microscopy

✔️ Shear profile measurements

---

Most importantly, all hardware designs, control software, and example datasets are openly available, ensuring that the instrument can be reused, adapted, and integrated into both research and teaching environments.
