**Rheology Meets Microscopy: A Multiscale Study of Sheared Soft Materials**

*Wednesday 09.04.2025 -- 16.00-17:00 (CEST)*

Join the Webinar organized by [Anton Paar](https://www.anton-paar.com/corp-en/) where [Roberto]({{< relref "/authors/admin/_index.md" >}}) explores innovative methods for integrating rheometry with optical microscopy. This approach allows for simultaneous measurement of bulk rheological properties and real-time observation of structural changes under shear.

The webinar will:

:arrow_right: Present recent advancements in a compact, stress- or strain-controlled rheometer tailored for rheo-microscopy applications.
