Somex Lab is excited to welcome four new members to the group: [Merisa Avdic]({{< relref "/authors/Merisa/_index.md" >}}), [Barnali Kumar]({{< relref "/authors/Barnali/_index.md" >}}), [Hannah Mittermayr]({{< relref "/authors/Hannah/_index.md" >}}) & [Franz Perko]({{< relref "/authors/Franz/_index.md" >}}).

As part of their Masterâ€™s theses, Merisa and Barnali will be investigating the micro- and bulk rheology of bioinks used in [3D bioprinting](https://www-nature-com.uaccess.univie.ac.at/articles/nbt.2958). Hannah will focus on developing an optical setup to measure the zeta potential of colloidal particles using electrophoretic mobility and Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM). Franz will work on his Bachelor's thesis focused on the motility and self-driven phase transitions of Myxococcus Xanthus bacteria.
