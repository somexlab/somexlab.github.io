We are delighted to host [Concetta Santangelo]({{< relref "/authors/Concetta/_index.md" >}}) from the University of Milan and [Andrea De Marco]({{< relref "/authors/Andrea/_index.md" >}}) from the University of Padova. This marks Concetta’s second visit to our group, following a productive three-month stay earlier this year.

Concetta’s work focuses on applying **FastDDM** for the quantitative characterization of biomolecular systems, while Andrea is exploring how the same technique can be used to study the viscoelastic behavior of electrolytes in redox flow batteries.

We’re excited to have them both on board and look forward to the insights their research will bring!
