We are excited to share the news that our most recent preprint, ***[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Differential Dynamic Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05058)*** has been submitted to arXiv. Authored by our postdocs [Enrico Lattuada]({{< relref "/authors/Enrico/_index.md" >}}) and [Maxime Lavaud]({{< relref "/authors/Maxime/_index.md" >}}), master student [Fabian Krautgasser]({{< relref "/authors/Fabian/_index.md" >}}), in collaboration with [Fabio Giavazzi](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/fabio-giavazzi).

Whether you're a soft matter physicist, biophysicist, or microscopy enthusiast—if you're looking to measure dynamics without tracking, this guide is for you.


A comprehensive tutorial that covers:

✔️ Physics of DDM

✔️ Mathematical foundations

✔️ Image formation

✔️ Practical data analysis

✔️ Common pitfalls

✔️ Real datasets & examples


Through this guide, we also introduce **[fastDDM](https://t.co/yDhRyW41fz)**—an open-source, high-performance Python package that speeds up DDM analysis by up to 4 orders of magnitude.


GPU + FFT + smart averaging = minutes instead of hours of image processing.


📊 **Reproducibility first!**

Each section is paired with Jupyter notebooks using real or datasets.
🔄 You can follow every step, run the code, and adapt it to your system.

✅ Educational

✅ Extensible

✅ Transparent


🧪 **What can you do with this tutorial?**

We guide you through:

✅ Particle sizing

✅ Merging fast & slow acquisitions

✅ Handling 2D vs. 3D dynamics

✅ Detecting axial drift & sedimentation

✅ Quantifying uncertainty

✅ Using image windowing

✅ Optimizing experimental design


🧵 Read it, 🔧 use it..
