We were delighted to host a brief but inspiring visit from **[Prof. Gerald G. Fuller](https://cheme.stanford.edu/people/gerald-fuller)** of Stanford University. Following his attendance at the [Annual European Rheology Conference](https://rheology-esr.org/aerc-2025/welcome/) in Lyon, France, Prof. Fuller made a quick stop in Vienna and spent time engaging with members of the Somex Lab and exploring our facilities.

During his visit, Prof. Fuller delivered a captivating seminar on his latest research titled **"*In Situ* Rheology of Mucus on Live Airway Epithelial Cell Cultures."** He shared how magnetorheology can be used to study the rheological properties of mucus directly on live Human Bronchial Epithelium (HBE) cultures. His talk offered valuable insights into the role of mucus viscoelasticity in the pathology of Muco-obstructive pulmonary diseases.
