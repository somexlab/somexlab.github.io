We are thrilled to welcome back [Eva Hudec]({{< relref "/authors/Eva/_index.md" >}}) to Somex Lab! Eva, a visiting student from the [University of Zagreb](https://www.unizg.hr/homepage/), previously joined us for a short internship and is now returning to conduct her Masterâ€™s thesis. Her research will focus on exploring the structure-property relationship during oscillatory recovery rheology of soft matter. To achieve her thesis goals, she will combine rheology with microscopy and advanced image processing techniques.
