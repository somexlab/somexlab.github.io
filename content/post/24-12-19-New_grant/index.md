A new research proposal titled: **Decoding and engineering multiscale mechanoresponses in synthetic and biological tissues** submitted by [Diana Pinheiro](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/diana-pinheiro), [Edouard Hannezo](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/hannezo-group/) and [Roberto Cerbino]({{< relref "/authors/admin/_index.md" >}}) (S/N: LS24-038) has been accepted by [Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF)](https://www.wwtf.at/).

The aim is to unravel the physical properties of living tissues that are encoded across biological scales, by employing a novel reductionist approach by blending material science, developmental biology and physics.
