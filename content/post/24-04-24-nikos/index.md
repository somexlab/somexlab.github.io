At the Outreach event organized by University of Vienna, PhD student **[N. Kalafatakis](https://mohan8488.github.io/group-website-test/author/nikolaos-kalafatakis/)** explained to the audience about the fascinating world of viscoelastic materials. He stressed on their importantance in our day-to-day life and use of different scientific methods such as Rheology for a better understanding of their flow behaviour.

He also highlighted the challenges on relying just on rheological measurements and showed how these challenges can be overcome. One such method being the coupling of advanced microscopic imaging techniques with rheology. He demonstrated the in-house developed **Shear cell** which can help solve some of the major limitations associated with rheology. 

N. Kalafatakis was able to provide a glimpse of the interesting world of Soft Matter Physics to a cheerful  audience of students and faculty from various academic backgrounds as they sipped their favorite beers.
