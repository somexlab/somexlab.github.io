We were delighted to host **[Prof. Luca Cipelletti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qXVjOJUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)** for a week-long visit as part of the **VDSP** ["Research in Teams"](https://vds-physics.univie.ac.at/activities/international-mobility/#:~:text=The%20VDSP%20initiative%20%22Research%20in,of%20guest%20researchers%20in%20Vienna.) initiative. During his stay, he shared his expertise on the dynamics of soft matter systems and engaged in insightful discussions with our group members about ongoing research projects.

As part of his visit, Prof. Cipelletti also delivered a talk at the *Computational and Soft Matter Physics Seminar*, where he presented his latest findings on the **Precursors of failures in polymer networks subjected to tensile stress.** *(Tuesday 11.03.2025 -- 13.15-14:45 -- PC Seminarraum 3, Kolingasse 14-16, OG02)*

Of course, the visit wasnâ€™t all work.. :grinning:
