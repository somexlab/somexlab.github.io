abstract: "We present measurements of the transient stage of Soret-driven convective instability. The sample is a diluted colloidal suspension of silica spheres in water with an unusually large negative Soret coefficient ST. A large temperature gradient (heating from above) is rapidly applied over the sample, while a shadowgraph imaging technique provides images of the convective flow. From the processing of the variance of the intensity of the images we are able to recover the time evolution of the overall intensity of the convective flow. A typical evolution of such signal exhibits, after a latency time, a peak followed by some damped oscillations leading to a steady-state value. Both the onset time τp (the temporal position of the first peak), and the oscillation period τosc show a power law dependence as a function of the solutal Rayleigh number Rs. The exponents found are compared with predictions from existing models."
