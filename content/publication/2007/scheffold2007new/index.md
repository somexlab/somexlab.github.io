abstract: "In this article we review some of the most important new developments in light scattering that have emerged over the past 10 years. Some of the new methods substantially extend the range of accessible time and length scales. Different cross-correlation methods are now available to suppress multiple scattering over a large concentration range. Novel low coherent light sources on the other hand have stimulated progress in the field of heterodyne detection. Many of these new approaches take advantage of the nowadays available area detectors such as high resolution CCD/CMOS video cameras. This has enabled large scale parallel processing of speckle intensity fluctuations and in consequence has provided a wealth of possibilities in dynamic light scattering such as multi-speckle detection and time resolved correlation analysis."
