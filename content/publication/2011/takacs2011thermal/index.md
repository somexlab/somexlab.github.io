abstract: "We report data for nonequilibrium density fluctuations in a layer of liquid CS 2 subjected to temperature gradients on Earth and in a satellite. The structure factor S (q) was measured using a calibrated shadowgraph. Upon removing gravity, S (q) increased dramatically at small wave vector, until the fluctuations generated by thermal noise were limited only by the 3 mm sample thickness. The results agree with theory to within a few percent on Earth and areâˆ¼ 14% below theory in microgravity, demonstrating that the use of equilibrium Langevin forces is appropriate in this nonequilibrium situation."
