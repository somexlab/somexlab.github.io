abstract: "X-rays have long been a precious tool for the study of the structure of matter. While the short wavelength makes them ideal for investigating materials down to the atomic scale, their high penetration power allows for the exploration of opaque samples at a multitude of length scales. We give an overview of the x-ray techniques suited for the characterization of soft matter and of their application to systems of current interest. We describe the advantages and limitations of existing x-ray methods and outline the possible developments following the introduction of a new kind of coherent source: the x-ray free electron laser."
