abstract: "Equilibrium fluctuations of thermodynamic variables, such as density or concentration, are known to be small and typically occur at a molecular length scale. In contrast, theory predicts that non-equilibrium fluctuations grow very large both in amplitude and spatial size. On earth, the presence of gravity and buoyancy forces severely limits the development of the fluctuations. We will present the results of a 14-year long international collaboration on an experiment on non-equilibrium fluctuations in a single liquid and in a polymer solution under microgravity conditions. Non-equilibrium conditions are generated by applying a temperature gradient across millimetre-size liquid slabs. Phase modulations introduced by fluctuations are measured using a quantitative shadowgraph method, with the optical axis parallel to the temperature gradient. Thousands of images are analysed and their two-dimensional power spectra â€¦"
