abstract: "This review summarizes recent progress in investigating polymer systems by using Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM), a rapidly emerging approach that transforms a commercial microscope by combining real‐space information with the powerful capabilities of conventional light scattering analysis. DDM analysis of a single microscope movie gives access to the sample dynamics in a wide range of scattering wave‐vectors, enabling contemporary polymer science experiments that would be difficult or impossible with standard light scattering techniques. Examples of application include the characterization of polymer solutions and networks, of polymer based colloidal systems, of biopolymers, and of cellular motility in polymeric fluids. Further applications of DDM to a variety of polymer systems are suggested to be just behind the corner and it is thus likely that DDM will become a tool of choice of the modern …"
