abstract: "Particle-tracking microrheology (PT-μ r) exploits the thermal motion of embedded particles to probe the local mechanical properties of soft materials. Despite its appealing conceptual simplicity, PT-μ r requires calibration procedures and operating assumptions that constitute a practical barrier to its wider application. Here we demonstrate differential dynamic microscopy microrheology (DDM-μ r), a tracking-free approach based on the multiscale, temporal correlation study of the image intensity fluctuations that are observed in microscopy experiments as a consequence of the translational and rotational motion of the tracers. We show that the mechanical moduli of an arbitrary sample are determined correctly over a wide frequency range provided that the standard DDM analysis is reinforced with an iterative, self-consistent procedure that fully exploits the multiscale information made available by DDM. Our approach to …"
