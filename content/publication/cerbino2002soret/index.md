abstract: "Convection in a colloidal suspension with a large negative separation ratio ψ is studied experimentally by heating from above. Shadowgraph observations at very large solutal Rayleigh numbers R ̃ are reported as a function of time. Fast relaxation oscillations are reported for the root mean square value of the shadowgraph intensity. While pure fluids exhibit a transition to turbulent convection for Rayleigh number R≃ 10 6, stable spoke-pattern planform with up and down columnar flows are observed up to R ̃≃ 1.9× 10 9. It is suggested that the surprising stability of the planform against turbulence is due to nonlinear focusing arising from the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient."
