abstract: Intermittent dynamics driven by internal stress imbalances in disordered systems is a fascinating yet poorly understood phenomenon. Here, we study it for a coarsening foam. By exploiting differential dynamic microscopy and particle tracking we determine the dynamical characteristics of the foam at different ages in reciprocal and direct space, respectively. At all wavevectors $q$ investigated, the intermediate scattering function exhibits a compressed exponential decay. However, the access to unprecedentedly small values of $q$ highlights the existence of two distinct regimes for the $q$-dependence of the foam relaxation rate $\Gamma(q)$. At high $q$, $\Gamma(q) \sim q$ consistent with directionally-persistent and intermittent bubble displacements. At low $q$, we find the surprising scaling $\Gamma(q) \sim q^{\delta}$, with $\delta$ = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.2. The analysis of the bubble displacement distribution in real space reveals the existence of a displacement cut-off of the order of the bubble diameter. Introducing such cut-off length in an existing model, describing stress-driven dynamics in disordered systems, fully accounts for the observed behavior in direct and reciprocal space.
