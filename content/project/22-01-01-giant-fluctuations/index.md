The [NEUF-DIX](https://nebula.esa.int/content/extension-sodi-instrument-neuf-dix-non-equilibrium-fluctuations-during-diffusion-complex) project, also known as the GIANT FLUCTUATIONS project, initiated and funded by the European Space Agency, focuses on investigating non-equilibrium fluctuations during diffusion in complex liquids under microgravity conditions. This research aims to explore, onboard the **International Space Station (ISS)**, phenomena that are difficult to model theoretically, particularly in multi-component fluids containing macromolecules like polymers and colloids. The project makes use of a specialized experiment unit on the ISS to conduct these studies, providing insights into thermal diffusion processes

The project also involves:
- University of Milan, Dep. Physics: Alberto Vailati, Marina Carpineti
- University of Milan, Dep. BIOMETRA: Fabio Giavazzi
- University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour (UPPA): Fabrizio Croccolo, Henri Bataller
- University of Bayreuth: Werner Köhler
- Universidad Complutense de Madrid: Loreto García-Fernández
