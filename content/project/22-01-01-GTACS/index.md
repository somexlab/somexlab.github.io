The GTACTS project also known as SEDIMENTING COLLOIDS has a primary objective to investigate the connection between velocity fluctuations and concentration fluctuations that occur during the sedimentation of particles in a fluid. This study will utilize the unique environment of microgravity in space to enhance understanding of colloidal systems and sedimentation processes, which are difficult to replicate accurately on Earth due to the influence of gravity. Experiments will be conducted onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by using the [FLUMIAS](https://issnationallab.org/iss360/miniature-microscope-aims-to-maximize-science/#:~:text=A%20miniaturized%20fluorescence%20microscope%20could,technology%20onboard%20the%20space%20station.) (Fluorescence Microscopy in the International Space Station) facility, a pioneering 3D fluorescence microscope developed by the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en), allowing to study dynamic changes in samples subjected to different gravitational environments, up to 1.1g.

The project also involves:

- University of Milan, Dep. BIOMETRA: Fabio Giavazzi 
- Heinrich Heine University: Stefan Egelhaaf (deceased)
