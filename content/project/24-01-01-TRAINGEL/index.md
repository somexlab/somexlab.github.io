***Transforming Gels Through Training*** or **(TRAINGEL)** is a collaborative research between France (ANR) and Austria (FWF). Within the main goal of the project, the primary focus will be on experiments using rheology, microscopy, rheo-microscopy, and DDM to train hydrogels for cell culture, as well as to train colloidal gels through mechanical solicitation or by altering in a controlled fashion the interaction between the colloidal particles.

The project also involves:
